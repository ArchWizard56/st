# st
This is a repo containing all the necessary PKGBUILDs and patches to build my version of st.

## Installation

As far as I know, the PKGBUILDs only work on ArchLinux, so this installation is only for Arch.
Start by getting the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/ArchWizard56/st.git
```
Next, enter the directory.
```
cd st
```
Then you can build and install the package with:
```
makepkg -si
```
